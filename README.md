# CursorWeave - Custom cursor manager for Windows

It's a Mousecape alternative for windows. \
I'm making this, because I couldn't find anything good enough, and Windows built-in one feels like it's outdated.

## Setup
- Create a directory at `%LOCALAPPDATA%/CursorWeave/themes` and save a sample theme with `manifest.json` and `arrow.cur` files. The sample themes folder and it's content can be referred from the `themes` directory in the root of the repository.

- Run `pnpm install`
- Run `pnpm tauri dev`

## Recommended IDE Setup
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
